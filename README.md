## What NASAQ is (and is not)

- **A layer, not a fork.** NASAQ is a set of plugins that run inside Omarchy's own Quickshell process. There is no second shell, no second notification daemon, no second lock screen. Omarchy keeps updating normally.
- **Nothing under `/usr/share/omarchy` is touched.** NASAQ lives in `~/.config/omarchy/plugins`, `~/.config/hypr/nasaq-*.lua`, `~/.local/bin` and `~/.config/omarchy/nasaq`. A post-update check warns you if an Omarchy update changed something NASAQ builds on.
- **Reversible.** The installer backs up every file it changes. `uninstall.sh` puts them back.
- **One settings window.** `SUPER + ALT + N` opens NASAQ Settings: 12 pages with real controls for every feature, including a Plugins page that turns any shell plugin on or off, whether NASAQ's, Omarchy's or a community one.
- **Built for more than one language.** The interface ships in English, with Arabic as the first additional language, including right-to-left layout. Translations are plain JSON files, so another language is one file away. Shortcuts keep working under non-Latin keyboard layouts, and OCR reads whichever languages you install.

## The name

NASAQ is an Arabic word for *order, harmony, a consistent pattern*: things arranged so they follow one line and fit together. Omarchy already gives you a beautiful Arch + Hyprland desktop shaped by DHH's taste. NASAQ is one person's taste layered on top of it: a desktop where every piece looks and behaves like the others, and everything is configured from one window.

## Features

### The bar

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/bar-left.png" alt="Bar, left" width="760"><br>
<img src="docs/screenshots/bar-center.png" alt="Bar, centre" width="420">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="docs/screenshots/bar-right.png" alt="Bar, right" width="400"></p>

Left: the Omarchy menu, pinned app launchers, and the **workspace numbers**. The active workspace is highlighted, workspaces that hold windows are shown in full, empty ones are dimmed. Centre: the Dynamic Island with the clock and the next prayer countdown. Right: tray, keyboard layout, Wi-Fi and power state. The bar is Omarchy's bar. NASAQ adds its widgets to it through `shell.json`, so `omarchy bar` commands still work.

### Dynamic Island

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/island.png" alt="Dynamic Island" width="420"></p>

The island in the top centre is a living element, in the spirit of Apple's Dynamic Island. Collapsed, it shows the time, and optionally a countdown to the next prayer. Click it and it expands into a card with the date (Gregorian, and Hijri if you want it), the weather, what is playing, and a stopwatch and Pomodoro timer. Volume and brightness OSDs, and notifications, appear by morphing the island itself rather than as separate pop-ups.

### Notifications and Notification Center

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/notification.png" alt="Notification" width="640"></p>

A notification grows out of the island, with the app icon, title and body, then shrinks back. Per-app rules let you mute, group, or keep an app's notifications quiet while Do Not Disturb is on.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/notification-center.png" alt="Notification Center" width="360"></p>

`SUPER + N` slides the Notification Center in from the right: history grouped by app, clear-all, and a Do Not Disturb switch.

### Control Center

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/control-center.png" alt="Control Center" width="420"></p>

`SUPER + ALT + C`, or a hot corner, opens a macOS-style Control Center: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, keyboard layout, Do Not Disturb, display brightness with auto-brightness, sound with an output picker, a Windows page (transparency, blur, shadows, shape), power profile, and lock / sleep / restart / shut down.

### Desktop widgets

A column of glass widgets sits on the desktop behind your windows (see the screenshot at the top): a large clock with the date, weather for your city, an optional prayer-times card, an Up Next card fed by iCal calendar links, a system card with CPU, memory and temperatures, Now Playing with media controls, and a Tasks / Notes card. `SUPER + ALT + D` hides and shows the column.

Make the column yours, in Settings > Widgets:

- Every card has an on/off switch. The column closes the gap where a card is off.
- Drag the handle next to a card to put the cards in any order.
- The Tasks / Notes card stretches to the bottom of the screen when it is last. Anywhere else it keeps a fixed height.
- Prayer times, in the column and in the Dynamic Island, are off with one switch if you do not need them.

### Spotlight

![Spotlight](docs/screenshots/spotlight.png)

`ALT + SPACE` opens Spotlight. Type to find apps (ranked by how often and how recently you open them), open windows, and files, with a Quick Look pane on the right that previews images, text and documents and shows size and date. Spotlight also does arithmetic, currency and unit conversion, and web search. Start a line with `?` and the rest is a question for your default Omarchy agent (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot or Gemini, whichever `omarchy default agent` points at). The answer appears inline.

### Mission Control

![Mission Control](docs/screenshots/mission-control.png)

`SUPER + TAB`, a three-finger swipe up, or the top-left hot corner opens Mission Control: live previews of every window on the current workspace, with the workspace strip at the top. Click a window to focus it, drag it to another workspace, or middle-click to close it.

### App Switcher

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/app-switcher.png" alt="App Switcher" width="720"></p>

`ALT + TAB` cycles windows in most-recently-used order with live previews, exactly like macOS: hold ALT, press TAB to move, release ALT to switch instantly. This needs one udev rule, which the installer offers; without it the switcher falls back to a short timer.

### Hot corners

Push the pointer into a corner to trigger an action. Defaults: top-left Mission Control, top-right Notification Center, bottom-left show desktop, bottom-right lock. Each corner is set from Settings > Workspaces & Windows.

### Scratchpads

![Scratchpad](docs/screenshots/scratchpad.png)

`` SUPER + ` `` drops a terminal over whatever you are doing and hides it again with the same key. Any app can be a scratchpad: add one in Settings > Workspaces & Windows with a command, a key and a size.

### NASAQ Settings

![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.png)

`SUPER + ALT + N`. Pages: General (interface language and direction, font, screenshots, OCR languages), Appearance, Bars & Panels, Widgets, Launcher, Notifications, Workspaces & Windows, System (displays with automatic revert, auto-brightness, devices, health checks), Shortcuts, AI & Automation, Plugins, Advanced. Every setting takes effect immediately. **Save snapshot** records all of NASAQ's files in a local git repository; **Restore** goes back to any snapshot, and a restore can itself be undone.

![Plugins page](docs/screenshots/settings-plugins.png)

The Plugins page lists every plugin the shell knows about, grouped as NASAQ, Omarchy and community, with a switch for each, a rescan button, and "Add a plugin from git". Plugins the rest of NASAQ depends on are marked Required.

![Shortcuts page](docs/screenshots/settings-shortcuts.png)

The Shortcuts page lists all shortcuts, Omarchy's and NASAQ's. Each can be changed to a different key or turned off, without editing Lua by hand and without losing Omarchy's updates: NASAQ writes a small remap layer that is loaded before Omarchy's defaults. The keyboard-layout switch regenerates every letter shortcut on key codes, so `SUPER + W`, `SUPER + Q` and friends keep working while a non-Latin layout (Arabic, for example) is active.

### More

- **Lock screen** with separate password and fingerprint flows, matching the theme.
- **Power**: an Apple-style Low Power Mode and per-profile behaviour (Saver, Balanced, Performance).
- **Display**: resolution, scale and position with a 15-second automatic revert, and auto-brightness from the ambient sensor or the clock.
- **Translation**: `SUPER + CTRL + ALT + L` translates the selected text; add SHIFT to OCR and translate a region of the screen. Both use your default Omarchy agent.
- **Universal clipboard**: `SUPER + C / V / X` copy, paste and cut in every app, including terminals.
- **Quit app**: `SUPER + Q` closes the whole application, not just one window.
- **Fix speakers**: `SUPER + ALT + A` rebinds the audio card when the speakers go silent (iMac and some laptops).
- **Window rules** and **automations** (time- or event-triggered commands), editable from Settings.
- **Screensaver modes**: Matrix, image, or Omarchy's stock ASCII.
- **Themes**: every NASAQ surface follows the active Omarchy theme and updates when you change it.
- **Screen frame** (off by default): a soft rounded frame in the theme colour drawn inside the window gaps.

## Shortcuts

All of Omarchy's own shortcuts stay as they are, and any of them can be changed from the Shortcuts page.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4.0.4 or newer, which brings Hyprland 0.56+ and Quickshell 0.3+. NASAQ uses Hyprland's Lua configuration and Omarchy's plugin system.
- Optional packages the installer offers: `tesseract-data-ara` (OCR data for Arabic; add other `tesseract-data-*` packages for your languages), `cava` (audio visualiser), `nwg-displays` (graphical display layout), `kitty` and `ptyxis` (scratchpad terminals).
- Optional: one of the Omarchy agents (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `gemini`) for Spotlight questions and translation.
- Optional prayer times come from [AlAdhan](https://aladhan.com), weather from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com), currency rates from [open.er-api.com](https://open.er-api.com). All are free and need no key.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghazi-alsaif/nasaq ~/.local/share/nasaq
cd ~/.local/share/nasaq
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. checks the Omarchy version and backs up `shell.json`, your three Hyprland Lua files and the menu extension into `~/.local/state/nasaq/`;
2. copies the plugins, scripts, hooks, sounds and defaults into your home directory;
3. adds one `pcall(dofile, ...)` line to each of `hyprland.lua`, `looknfeel.lua` and `bindings.lua`, so NASAQ's layers load with yours;
4. adds NASAQ's widgets to the bar and NASAQ's entries to the Omarchy menu;
5. offers the optional packages and the udev rule for the App Switcher (`sudo` for that one step);
6. restarts the shell.

`./install.sh --yes` accepts every optional step. When it finishes, press `SUPER + ALT + N`.

Set your city for weather (and prayer times, if you use them) in Settings > Widgets. Pick the interface language in Settings > General.

## Update

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nasaq && ./update.sh
```

`update.sh` pulls the latest release and runs `install.sh --update`, which refreshes NASAQ's files and leaves your bar layout, menu and settings alone.

## Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nasaq && ./uninstall.sh          # restores the backed-up files
cd ~/.local/share/nasaq && ./uninstall.sh --purge  # also removes NASAQ's settings
```

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nasaq.*` | the 21 plugins |
| `~/.config/omarchy/nasaq/` | settings.json, island.json, windows.json, help |
| `~/.config/omarchy/nasaq/secrets.json` | private calendar links (never exported or snapshotted) |
| `~/.config/hypr/nasaq-*.lua` | generated Hyprland layers (binds, rules, corners, scratchpads, layout binds, remaps) |
| `~/.local/bin/nasaq-*` | helper scripts (settings snapshots, display, translation, scratchpads, ...) |
| `~/.local/state/nasaq/` | install backups |
| `~/.local/share/nasaq-settings/` | the snapshot repository |

## Languages

The NASAQ interface is available in **English** (default) and **Arabic**, with automatic right-to-left layout. Every string lives in `plugins/nasaq.commons/i18n/<language>.json`, so adding a language means adding one JSON file. Omarchy's own menus (such as `SUPER + SPACE`) stay in English.
